    // comments are used to explain to other fellow developers why we have written this code this way 
    // no need to explain what this code does -- code is self explanatory 
    

    // Example - logging something in the console ---- NO 
    console.log('Hello world Im in browser')

    //alert('Hello');
    // this alert function - alerts the user in the website by a pop up dialog box with a given message 
    //alert("Hello");

  </script> -->
</body>
</html>
<!-- we will be using the html as a host to the javascript codes  -->
<!-- we can write the script in either the head or in the body section  -->
<!-- According to best practices it is better to write the script section inside
the body section after all the elements  -->

<!--  the reason why we  write the script section at the end of the body section is that 
the browser parses the file from top to bottom , so if the script section is present in the head 
then threre would be a problem , as the browser will load up the script first not the content of the webpage 
thus resulting in bad user experience -->

<!-- there can be 3rd party js codes which is an exception and needs to be put into the head section 
otherwise the best practice is to write it in the last of the body section  -->

<!-- Separation of Concerns - As in any practical world scenario there will be millions of line of code 
it is not feasible to write the js code inside the html file , as we dont keep our clothes in the kitchen we keep it in the bedroom 
inside of a wardrobe , just like that js code should be seperated  -->

<!-- also the html - signifies the content of a webpage and the Js signifies the behaviour of a webpage 
Ex - when we hover what will happen like that  -->
