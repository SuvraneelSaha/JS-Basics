we can add that here in the head section
or in the end of the body section

best - end of body section

<script> 
This is the script inside of which we will write the js code 
</script>
 Reasons why we write the js code an the end of the body section 
 the reason is that the browser parses the code from top to bottom and if the js code is present in the head section then the browser will take time to parse the js code . whereas the content wont be displayed on the website and our user will just stare at the blank screen , waiting for our browser to finish parsing the js code . all in all it is a bad user experience 

2nd reason 
the elements need to interact with the js code
present inside the script tag 

exceptions for 3rd party codes 

html all about content 
js - all about behavior 

 Node is a runtime environment for executing js code outside of a browser !!!
